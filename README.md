[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fitting.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fitting)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/funbox/fitting.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/funbox/fitting)

This gem will help you implement your API in strict accordance to the documentation in [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) format.
To do this, when you run your RSpec tests on controllers, it automatically searches for the corresponding json-schemas in the documentation and then validates responses with them.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fitting'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fitting

## Usage

In your `spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require 'fitting'

Fitting.statistics

Fitting.configure do |config|
  config.apib_path = '/path/to/doc.apib'
end
```

or

```ruby
require 'fitting'

responses = Fitting::Storage::Responses.new

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.after(:each, type: :controller) do
    responses.add(response)
  end

  config.after(:suite) do
    responses.statistics.save
  end
end

Fitting.configure do |config|
  config.apib_path = '/path/to/doc.apib'
end
```

## Example output

After running tests you will get statistics in the file `fitting/stats`:

```
Fully conforming requests:
DELETE  /api/v1/book                 ✔ 200 ✔ 201 ✔ 404
DELETE  /api/v1/book/{id}            ✔ 200 ✔ 201 ✔ 404
GET     /api/v1/book/{id}/seller     ✔ 200 ✔ 201 ✔ 404

Partially conforming requests:
GET     /api/v1/book                 ✖ 200 ✔ 404
POST    /api/v1/book                 ✖ 200 ✔ 201 ✔ 404
GET     /api/v1/book/{id}            ✖ 200 ✔ 404 ✔ 200
PATCH   /api/v1/book/{id}            ✖ 200 ✔ 201 ✔ 404

Non-conforming requests:
GET     /api/v1/seller               ✖ 200 ✖ 201 ✖ 404
GET     /api/v1/buyer                ✖ 200 ✖ 404

API requests with fully implemented responses: 3 (33.33% of 9).
API requests with partially implemented responses: 4 (44.44% of 9).
API requests with no implemented responses: 2 (22.22% of 9).

API responses conforming to the blueprint: 16 (64.00% of 25).
API responses with validation errors or untested: 9 (36.00% of 25).
```

Also you will get not covered responses in the file `fitting/not_covered`.

## Matchers

If you want to know why you get crosses instead of checkmarks you can use matchers for RSpec.

```ruby
config.include Fitting::Matchers, type: :controller
```

### match_schema

Makes a simple validation against JSON Schema.

```ruby
expect(response).to match_schema
```

### strictly_match_schema

Makes a strict validation against JSON Schema. All properties are condisidered to have `"required": true` and all objects `"additionalProperties": false`.

```ruby
expect(response).to strictly_match_schema
```

## Config

You can specify the settings either in a yaml file `.fitting.yml` or in config.
If your project uses several prefixes, for each one you need to create a separate yaml file in the folder `fitting` (`fitting/*.yml`).

### apib_path

Path to API Blueprint documentation. There must be an installed [drafter](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter) to parse it.

### drafter_yaml_path

Path to API Blueprint documentation pre-parsed with `drafter` and saved to a YAML file.

### strict

Default `false`. If `true` then all properties are condisidered to have `"required": true` and all objects `"additionalProperties": false`.

### prefix

Prefix of API requests. Example: `'/api'`. Validation will not be performed if the request path does not start with a prefix.

### white_list

Default: all paths. This is an array of paths that are mandatory for implementation.
This list does not affect the work of the matcher.
This list is only for the report in the console.

```ruby
config.white_list = {
  '/users' =>                ['DELETE', 'POST'],
  '/users/{id}' =>           ['GET', 'PATCH'],
  '/users/{id}/employees' => ['GET'],
  '/sessions' =>             []
}
```

Empty array `[]` means all methods.

### resource_white_list

Default: all resources. This is an array of resources that are mandatory for implementation.
This list does not affect the work of the matcher.
This list is only for the report in the console.

```ruby
config.resource_white_list = {
  '/users' =>                ['DELETE /users/{id}', 'POST /users', 'GET /users/{id}', 'PATCH /users/{id}'],
  '/users/{id}/employees' => ['GET /users/{id}/employees'],
  '/sessions' =>             []
}
```

Empty array `[]` means all methods.

### ignore_list

You can use ignore list for omit checks with matchers.

```ruby
config.ignore_list = [%r{/api/v1/users/[1-9].}, %r{/api/v1/comments}]
```

It's work only for match_schema (NOT FOR strictly_match_schema)

### include and exclude
If you not need check all documentation, you can include or exclude groups, resources and actions.
But be carrefully, we advices try to avoid, because easy to get confused. Watch for warnings.

If you doesn't use `include_` and `exclude_`, then default include all.

The order of the call is improtant.
Each subsequent setting is performed from the result of the previous setting.

If use first `include_`, then default exclude all.
If use first `exclude_`, then default include all.

* include_groups
* include_resources
* include_actions
* explude_groups
* exclude_resources
* exclude_actions

Just fill the array with headers.
